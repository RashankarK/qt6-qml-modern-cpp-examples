# LambdaWithWrapper Project

This project demonstrates the use of lambda signals and modern function wrappers in a Qt 6 application. It showcases how to create a simple user interface using QML and connect signals and slots in a clean and efficient manner.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **LambdaWithWrapper.pro**: The project file that contains configuration settings for building the application.
- **main.cpp**: The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the Qt environment and loading the QML interface.
- **App.qml**: The QML file that defines the user interface layout and components.
- **wrappers.h**: A header file that declares modern function wrappers for signal-slot connections.
- **wrappers.cpp**: The implementation file for the function wrappers declared in `wrappers.h`.

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `LambdaWithWrapper` directory.
2. Run the following command to generate the Makefile:
   ```
   qmake LambdaWithWrapper.pro
   ```
3. Compile the project using:
   ```
   make
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   ./LambdaWithWrapper
   ```

## Usage

The application provides a simple interface where users can interact with buttons that utilize lambda signals for event handling. The modern function wrappers simplify the connection of signals and slots, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical example of using lambda expressions and modern function wrappers in Qt 6, enhancing the development experience and improving code readability.
